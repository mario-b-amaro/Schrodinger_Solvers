# Schrodinger_Solvers
A collection of time-dependent and time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation solvers for 1D, 2D, 3D and radial geometries using Finite Difference Method (FDM). In this repository you can find two folders:
- TI: Time-independent solvers
- TD: Time-dependent solvers

Inside each of the folders is a collection of solvers for each geometry. The structure of the codes is made to be as straight-forward as possible, and fully customizable.
Please report any bugs, issues or suggestions to marioam@kth.se.
